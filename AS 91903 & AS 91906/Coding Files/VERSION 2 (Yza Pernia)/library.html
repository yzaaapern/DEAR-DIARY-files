                            Today was pretty great. I was able to wake up early and finish all of my homework, even though I gamed for a few hours.
                            I felt good too.

                            I think I have finally moved on from him. My heart doesn't flutter anymore when I see him. I don't look for him anymore. It doesn't hurt me when he talks to other girls. Honestly, as I should. I'm a girlboss.
