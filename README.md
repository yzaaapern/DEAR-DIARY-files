# DEAR-DIARY-files
This repository contains all the files of for my DEAR DIARY web app.

It is a web app made from HTML, CSS, and Django. Each folder, named VERSION 1, 2, and 3, contain files that showcase the gradual development of the web app. Starting from VERSION 1, which is the rough layout of the interface, and heads on to VERSION 2, which contains the fully developed layout of the web interface. The last folder, which is VERSION 3, contains the files needed to complete the app. This includes the HTML, CSS, and Django files. 

This repository also contains the written log of my web app, starting from its research. 

**Current Progress
Date:
    21. 06. 2021:
>> currently in the process of uploading VERSION 1 & 2 folders into github. in case anything goes wrong with my USB and i lose the offline copy of my files, this will save a copy of my files online.
>> also in the process of researching how to run a django web app without having to use a CMD. if there is a possibility that i fail to find out how to do so, i will possibly create a recorded video of how my web app functions. 
>> i am also currently trying to find out how to put django files in a USB, so i can easily work on it from any computer. however, as i am afraid of losing my pre-existing files, i have decided to upload them here in github.
    22 . 06 . 2021:
>> discovered that my web app does not need to be deployed in order to function. this means that i would only need to submit a video of how my web app works.
>> however, i also cannot work on my web app through my usb, so my files will stay in my laptop as i develop it.
>> the folder containing the django framework will be added in this repository soon.
